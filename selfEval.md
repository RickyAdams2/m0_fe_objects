# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? I struggled with when I needed to define a variable, and when I didn't. I was sometimes putting "var" before the Object, and while I wasn't getting an error message. I wasn't getting a response from my terminal or replit either.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note-taking is going pretty well. I have a great color-coating system that allows me to look for key words and key information instead of having to look for it. I think I take my notes best at night or early early morning. I tend to always take thorough notes which can sometimes take a very ling time.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I try to solve a problem in code on my own first. Usually I'll go paste the code in Replit because it can tell me exactly where the issue occurred if I'm unable to find it on my own. If I feel like I've spent more than 5 minutes in search of an answer, then I will look online for help.
